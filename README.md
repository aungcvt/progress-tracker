progress-tracker
================

just a simple progress tracker

javascript is optional, only for dynamic list.
This example include four items in tracker, so item ( list ) width is 100/4 percent (25%).
If you have 5 items, you may need to change tracker li width to 100/5 percent, which is 20%.

If not, you don't know how many items in your tracker list, you can use tracker.js file to calculate width automatically.
I am using jquery for calculating width in js file. So you may need jquery.

have fun!
